# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This project is intended to allow users to track important events throughout the work day. It presents the user with time blocks for each hour of the work day. The user can then enter important events for each time block and save those details to local storage.

## Usage

[Work Day Scheduler](https://michaelhermes.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

A user is able to click inside any time block to enter the details of an important event. Clicking the blue save button on the right-side of the time block will save that event into local storage. The next time the page loads, any stored events will be recalled from local storage and pre-populate the appropriate time block. Deleting all text and saving will remove the event from storage.
